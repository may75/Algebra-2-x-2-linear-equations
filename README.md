# Algebra: 2 x 2 linear equations
Define linearequation class with a, b, c, d, e, and f arguments. create six
>> methods to return value of a,b,c,d,e and f arguments.
>> define get_x methid to calculate the x value and get_y to calculate the y
value from the argument values. Define is_solvable method to return and 
 calculate value to judge the equation solvable.
The two equations of the system are: 
###
          ax + by = e
          cx + dy = f
          
>> Depend on is_solvable method value call the get_x and get_y methods
